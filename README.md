# Alephbeis Elementry Font

This repo contains the Alephbeis Elementry Font designed by [Meir Sadan](https://meirsadan.com/) in collaboration with the team at [Alephbeis](alephbeis.org).

## About

Alephbeis Elementry was designed to create a curriculum for students to learn the letterforms or the Aleph Beis (or Aleph Bet) and Nekudos (or Nekudot).
The letterforms are based on the classic Vilna typeface and adapted in different styles which enables the creation of exercises, worksheets and games to teach young children to become familiar with the Aleph Beis.
